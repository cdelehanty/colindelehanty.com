    ## Waypoints

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	I’m a photographer specializing in time-lapse photography, with expertise in
	motion-controlled and remote camera systems. My passion for photography grew
	in Yosemite, where I learned the value of teamwork through Project Yosemite.
	There, I worked alongside Sender Films on projects that explored the history
	of climbing culture in Yosemite Valley, record-breaking climbs by [Alex
	Honnold](/work/honnold-triple/) and the first-ever [Dawn
	Wall](/work/dawn-wall) free climb. Since my start in Yosemite, I’ve
	contributed to four feature-length films, six short films, four installations,
	and collaborated with over 20 clients.

	At Obscura Digital, a San Francisco-based creative studio, I contributed to
	the development of content programs for architectural media integrations and
	large-scale projection mapping experiences for clients such as [MGM
	Cotai](/work/mgm-cotai/) and MSG Sphere. Building on my experience with
	immersive multimedia experiences and my background in time-lapse photography,
	I created the Fog City Module—a key component of Gensler's digital art
	experience at [88 Kearny Street](/work/88-kearny/) in downtown San Francisco.

	Outside of work, outdoor adventure in the San Francisco Bay Area is part of a
	daily routine, keeping me grounded and connected to both myself and the
	inspiring community around me. I’m also actively developing this
	[website](https://github.com/cdelehanty/colindelehanty.com) and exploring 3D
	Environment Art using programs like Houdini and Unreal Engine.

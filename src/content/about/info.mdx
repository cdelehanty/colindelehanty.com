    ## Waypoints

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	Colin is skilled in production and post-production, specializing in photography and digital media
	production, with expertise in time-lapse techniques. His passion for photography took root in
	Yosemite, where he collaborated on the time-lapse series [Project
	Yosemite](https://vimeo.com/projectyose). He has since worked with production companies like
	Sender Films, documenting climbing culture in [Valley
	Uprising](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/valley-uprising/), capturing record-breaking climbs
	by Alex Honnold in [Honnold 3.0](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/honnold-triple/), and
	chronicling the first-ever Dawn Wall free climb in [The Dawn
	Wall](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/the-dawn-wall/).

    Building on his documentary filmmaking experiences, Colin expanded his portfolio by collaborating
    with leading brands like [Apple](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/apple-campaigns/) and
    [Airbnb](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/airbnb-experiences/), using time-lapse photography to
    showcase new products and experiences. At Obscura Digital, a San Francisco-based creative studio,
    he contributed to content programs for large-scale architectural media integrations and projection
    mapping experiences such as [MGM Cotai](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/mgm-cotai/), [Art on
    The Mart](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/art-on-the-mart/), and MSG Sphere.

    Colin created the Fog City module for Gensler's digital art experience at [88 Kearny
    Street](https://www.colindelehanty.com/work/88-kearny/) in downtown San Francisco, leveraging his
    background in immersive experiences and time-lapse photography. Today, Colin extends his
    photography through the use of image-based 3D technologies and computational photography
    techniques applied to 3D Environments.

    Outside of work, outdoor adventures in the San Francisco Bay Area are a core part of his creative
    process, grounding him in the landscapes and communities that inspire him.

    ## Fog City

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">

Fog City is part of a digital art experience created by Gensler for Nuveen
in the redesigned lobby of 88 Kearny Street, San Francisco.

I worked with Gensler to create up to 10 landscape time-lapses,
each with a 2-minute playtime, featuring six locations in the San Francisco
Bay Area during the height of the fog season. The challenge came from the
unpredictable weather patterns, which made it difficult to plan locations,
days, and times for shooting. To address this, I worked closely with the
client to define clear goals for the project, supported by image testing
and weather data.

I presented reference images depicting various locations and levels of
fog activity for review. I also scouted the selected locations and conducted
on-site and VR tests with both creative and technical leads. This collaborative
process helped us define a shooting schedule that was supported by weather
data and allowed me to build a shot list for each location.

As a result, I captured 27 time-lapse sequences over 9 shoot days and successfully
delivered 6 approved time-lapses on schedule for the lobby opening, receiving
positive feedback from the end-client. My responsibilities throughout
the project included pre-production planning and location scouting, time-lapse
photography, and post-production editing and delivery.

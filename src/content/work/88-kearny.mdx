    ## Fog City

</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Goal:** Create up to 10 landscape and urban time-lapses of 6 locations in the San Francisco Bay
	Area at the height of the fog season.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Challenge:** Unpredictable weather patterns was the greatest challenge. Deciding which
	locations, days and times of day to shoot would require defined goals for the project supported by
	client feedback, image testing and weather data.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Action:** Present reference images depicting various locations and levels of fog activity for
	review. Scout selected locations and test images both on-site and in VR with creative and
	technical leads. Define shoot schedule supported by collected weather data and build a shot list for each location.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Result:** Delivered 6 approved time-lapses on schedule for lobby opening and received positive
	feedback from the end-client.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Core Responsibilities:** Planning, Location Scouting, Photography, Editing, Color

## Get Up Close to Mars

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	This unique experience conincided with Mars being it's closest to Earth in 15
	years and the longest lunar eclipse of the 21st century. Working with the two
	hosts of the event and a small film crew, I captured day-to-night time-lapses
	and footage during our private tour of GTC which was used by Airbnb to promote
	the upcoming experience.

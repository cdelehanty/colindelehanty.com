    ## iPhone and iPad Launch Campaigns

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	I worked with Apple as a photographer on multiple productions, capturing media
	shot on pre-release versions of the iPhone and iPad to demonstrate the
	capabilities of their new hardware for product launches. A highlight from
	these productions was the selection of three time-lapses to showcase the new
	time-lapse feature introduced with iOS 8, first on the iPhone 6 (Sept 2014)
	and later on the iPad Air 2 (Oct 2014). The time-lapses were featured in
	product announcements, digital media, and in-store demos, receiving positive
	feedback from Apple's top executives.

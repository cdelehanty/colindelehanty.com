	To bring time-lapse to the masses, Apple simplified the process of capturing
	time-lapse videos in their devices. Learning how to use Apple's new devices to
	capture time-lapse and aligning those learnings with Apple's creative vision
	was an exciting challenge that resulted in multiple time-lapses being picked
	to showcase the new feature to the public.

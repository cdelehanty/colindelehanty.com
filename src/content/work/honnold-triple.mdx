	## The Triple Crown

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	Alex worked with Sender Films to document his speed ascent of Yosemite's three
	largest rock faces, Mount Watkins, El Capitan, and Half Dome. The climb took
	19 hours and involved a team of filmmakers stationed at each of the walls. I
	was tasked with documenting Alex in time-lapse as he climbed the Nose of El
	Capitan throughout the night.

## Gigapan Photography

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	To introduce the Triple Crown, a 3D representation of each rock face was
	created. I was commisioned by Sender Films to create three Gigapixel images
	used in this portion of the film. Links to the full resolution images can be
	found [here](https://gigapan.com/profiles/delehanty).

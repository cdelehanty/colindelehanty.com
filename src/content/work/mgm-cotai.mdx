	**Goal:** Deliver 26 fully reviewed modules totalling 260 minutes of custom
	content consisting of editing and spatialization of assets across 25 separate
	screen displays for a comprehensive media deployment.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Challenge:** Each module integrated assets from multiple location shoots and
	various acquisition sources, making it challenging to achieve cohesive visuals
	and smooth composition. Given the number of assets and revisions, a reliable
	system was needed to manage assets, track changes, and ensure consistent
	updates across the team. Ensuring color fidelity and overall visual quality
	required specialized workstations and display setups, as well as rigorous
	quality control (QC) workflows to catch errors early and finalize polished
	content.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Action:** Developed and maintained asset management and tracking systems,
	improving collaboration between producers, artists, and colorists.
	Standardized asset workflows, preparing all project files with online-offline
	media for efficient integration. Set up multiple colorist workstations
	equipped with LED slice to provide accurate visual reference. Led the QC
	review process, identifying and reporting errors, while implementing necessary
	fixes to ensure visual consistency. Oversaw the rendering and delivery of all
	assets, and archived project files for future use in content delivery.
</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Result:** Successful delivery and on-site testing of all assets, meeting the
	project's visual and technical requirements. A second round of modules was
	requested and delivered in significantly less time using the established asset
	management system and streamlined workflow.

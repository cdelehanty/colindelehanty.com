## Windows of The World

    I worked with the team at Obscura Digital to deliver 26 modules totaling 260
    minutes of custom content. Each module involved editing and spatializing
    assets across 25 separate LED screen displays, contributing to a comprehensive
    media deployment.

    The complexity of each module arose from integrating assets from multiple
    location shoots and various acquisition sources, which made achieving cohesive
    visuals and smooth compositions challenging. The large volume of assets and
    required revisions demanded a reliable system for managing files, tracking
    changes, and ensuring consistent updates across the team. Additionally,
    maintaining color fidelity and overall visual quality required specialized
    workstations, display setups, and rigorous quality control (QC) workflows to
    identify errors early and deliver polished content.

    To address these challenges, I developed and maintained asset management and
    tracking systems that facilitated improved collaboration between producers,
    artists, and colorists. I standardized asset workflows and prepared project
    files with online-offline media for seamless integration. Multiple colorist
    workstations, equipped with LED slice for accurate visual reference, were set
    up. I also led the QC review process, identifying and resolving errors in
    media to ensure visual consistency. I oversaw the rendering and delivery of
    all assets, coordinating with technical artists and render wranglers to ensure
    timely and efficient processing, while archiving 26TB of project data for future
    content delivery.

    The result was the successful delivery and on-site testing of all 26 modules,
    meeting the project's visual and technical requirements. A second round of
    modules was requested and delivered in significantly less time using the
    established systems. My responsibilities included asset management, workflow
    development, technical assistance, compositing, motion graphics, quality
    control, render wrangling, and archiving.

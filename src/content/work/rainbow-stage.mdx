    ## Rainbow Stage

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">

    **Goal:** Create a time-lapse that combines the construction project and concert into a single
    sequence.

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Challenge:** To capture this shot the camera needed to remain in one location for the duration
	and be monitored periodicly. The only location option we were given to shoot did not have a
	mounting point for the camera and was only accesible with the supervision of a facilities
	crewmember. Monitoring the camera remotely was not an option.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Action:** Build a custom tripod head for the camera system so it could be mounted to a
	freestanding tripod. Coordinate meeting schedule with facilities crewmember to perform periodic
	on-site maintainence. Program camera system to adjust shoot schedule in anticipation of key
	events.
</MDXContainer>
<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	**Result:** Successfully installed a camera system that carried out the programmed time-lapse
	without interruption.

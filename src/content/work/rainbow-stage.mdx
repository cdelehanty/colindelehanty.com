    ## Rainbow Stage

</MDXContainer>

<MDXContainer containerType="text">
	I worked with Apple to create a seamless time-lapse that combined the
	construction of the Rainbow Stage at Apple Park with the celebratory concert
	into one continuous sequence.
	
    The primary challenge was ensuring the camera remained in a fixed location for
    the entire two-month duration while being periodically monitored. The only
    available shooting location lacked a mounting point for the camera and was
    accessible only under the supervision of a facilities crewmember.
    Additionally, remote monitoring was not an option, making on-site maintenance
    more complex.

    To overcome these obstacles, I designed and built a custom tripod head to
    securely mount the camera system to a freestanding tripod. I coordinated a schedule
    with the facilities crewmember to gain periodic access for on-site
    maintenance. I also programmed the camera system to dynamically adjust its
    shooting schedule, allowing it to capture key moments during the construction
    and concert phases.

    The result was a seamlessly executed time-lapse, capturing 3,564 frames over
    54 shooting days without interruption. I handled the installation,
    maintenance, post-production editing, and final delivery of a polished
    35-second video that documented the project from start to finish.
